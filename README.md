# 	Scalability of Web Systems

This course is designed as part of the "Web Systems" specialisation of the "Design Track" of the "Software Development and Technology" program, and builds on parts of the following courses:
- "Introduction to Database Design" (SIDD)
- "Introductory Programming" (GP)
- "System Architecture and Security" (SSSAS)
- The course is a sibling of "Frameworks and Archtectures for the Web" (FRWAW), and it is recommended to attended FRWAW before this course. 

Web services constitute the backbone of most of the successful internet companies we see today. For such a web service it is not only important that it delivers a certain functionality, but it is decisive that it does so to a huge user base in a fast and reliable manner.
This course focuses on the underlying principles that allow to scale a web service to such loads and to do so in a manageable and secure way.

Specific topics include:
- server side programming (e.g. PHP, javascript, ...)
- deployment and maintenance of a web service in a virtual environment (cloud)
- load balancing and the power of two choices
- latency requirements if many services are used
- distributed databases and the CAP theorem
- UTF and other encoding schemes
- statistics and performance measures
- security and input sanitization
- basics of multithreaded programming
- performance measurement of a web service 

This repo contains the hand-in project for Scalability of Web Systems.
